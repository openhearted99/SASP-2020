--INTRO--
The code in this folder has been written to run in the Jupyter Lab enviorment
provided by the illustris-tng simulation team. Details for creating an account
and requesting access to a Jupyter Lab enviorment can be found at
https://www.tng-project.org/data/lab/

A warm and sincere thanks to Dr. Greg Snyder (stsci.edu/~gsnyder)!
Almost all of this code is his work.


--CODE--
Each of the lightcone catalog generation scrips,
"tng_lightcone_catalogX.0.py" provides diffrent functionality.
1.0 is the original version of the script.
2.0 is optimized for the Jupyter Lab enviorment, with little functional change from the user perspective.
